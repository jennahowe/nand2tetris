/**
 * The Hack CPU (Central Processing unit), consisting of an ALU,
 * two registers named A and D, and a program counter named PC.
 * The CPU is designed to fetch and execute instructions written in 
 * the Hack machine language. In particular, functions as follows:
 * Executes the inputted instruction according to the Hack machine 
 * language specification. The D and A in the language specification
 * refer to CPU-resident registers, while M refers to the external
 * memory location addressed by A, i.e. to Memory[A]. The inM input 
 * holds the value of this location. If the current instruction needs 
 * to write a value to M, the value is placed in outM, the address 
 * of the target location is placed in the addressM output, and the 
 * writeM control bit is asserted. (When writeM==0, any value may 
 * appear in outM). The outM and writeM outputs are combinational: 
 * they are affected instantaneously by the execution of the current 
 * instruction. The addressM and pc outputs are clocked: although they 
 * are affected by the execution of the current instruction, they commit 
 * to their new values only in the next time step. If reset==1 then the 
 * CPU jumps to address 0 (i.e. pc is set to 0 in next time step) rather 
 * than to the address resulting from executing the current instruction.
